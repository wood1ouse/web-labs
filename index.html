            <h2>Kyiv</h2>
            <br />
            <p>Kyiv is an important industrial, scientific, educational and cultural center of Eastern Europe. It is
                home to
                many high-tech industries, higher education institutions, and historical landmarks. The city has an
                extensive system of public transport and infrastructure, including the Kyiv Metro.

                The city's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of its four legendary founders. During its
                history, Kyiv, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of prominence
                and
                obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century. A Slavic
                settlement
                on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople, Kyiv was a tributary of the
                Khazars,[15]
                until its capture by the Varangians (Vikings) in the mid-9th century. </p>
